# DSIP-project
This is my project from the course of Digital Signal and Image Processing (University of Genoa, 2025). The objective of the project is to study the use of two-dimensional wavelets for denoising and compressing images. In particular, I dedicated more time to the analysis and the comparison of different wavelet types on the same task.
